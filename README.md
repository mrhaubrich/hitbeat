## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a template for a Desktop application using Flutter. It's a simple project that uses Flutter Modular and SidebarX to create a sidebar and nested routes. It's a good starting point for a desktop application.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Because we use `super_context_menu`, you need to have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed:

For macOS or Linux, execute the following command in Terminal:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

In case you have Rust already installed, make sure to update it to latest version:
```bash
rustup update
```

To use this template, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
